- Fill (Insert text into a box)
- Select (Multiple choice)
- Calculate (Compute a numeric result from given concrete values)


Example syntax for Diffie-Hellman

protocol: Diffie-Hellman
participants: Alice, Bob

step 1:
    description: Alice chooses secret a
    exercise:
        type: fill
        prompt: Choose Alice's secret exponent
        hint: Choose a random integer in the range [2, p-2]
        answer: 2 < $1 < p-2
step 2:
    description: Alice computes her public key A
    exercise:
        type: construct
        prompt: Construct the expression for Alice to calculate her public key A
        hint: Bob uses the same expression to calculate B
        palette: g, a, p, ^, mod, *
        answer: g ^ a mod p
step 3:
    description: Alice sends A to Bob
step 4:
    description: Bob chooses secret b
    exercise:
        type: fill
        prompt: Choose Bob's secret exponent b
        hint: Choose a random integer in the range [2, p-2]
        answer: 2 < $1 < p-2
step 5:
    description: Bob computes his public key B
    exercise:
        type: select
        prompt: Which expression does bob use to calculate his public key B
        hint: Alice uses the same expression to calculate A
        options:
            - b^g mod p
            - p^b mod g
            - g^b mod p
        answer: g^b mod p
step 6:
    description: Bob sends B to Alice
step 7:
    description: Alice computes shared key
    exercise:
        type: calculate
        prompt: Compute the shared key for Alice and Bob, when a = 4, b = 5, p = 23, g = 5
        hint: The formula is A ^ b mod p and B ^ a mod p
        answer: 12
